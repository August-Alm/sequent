## normalization

We shall describe a normalization transformation N from Core to Cut.

Producers and consumers can occur either directly in cuts or as nested arguments of
constructors and destructors. In Cut, we demand that all arguments of constructors and
destructors are variables, a restriction similar to A-normal form. To express programs
under this restriction, we use µ- and µ˜-bindings to lift producers and consumers out of
argument positions. For example, suppose that C is a constructor with a producer argument
p, which is not a variable, and C(p) is cut with some consumer c.

N[ ⟨C (p) | c⟩ ] = ⟨p | µ˜x.⟨C (x) | c⟩⟩

The producer p is bound to variable x using the µ˜-binding so that the argument of C
becomes a variable. More generally, we use the following transformation rules to give
a name to each non-variable subexpression.

N[⟨C (..., p, ...) | c0 ⟩] = N[⟨p | µ˜x.N[⟨C (..., x, ...) | c0⟩]⟩] where x is fresh
